### Task Five

---

#### _Curve Balls_

##### _Scenario 1_

The team has a scheduled daily stand-up at 9 am in the morning. The meetings usually take over an hour. A lot of time is spent discussing a tricky dependency between several tasks that requires extensive conversation.

###### Diagnosis

> The daily stand-up is mainly meant for bringing everybody on the same table; for a complex problem like this needs organization


###### Remedy

   > • The issue have to be simplified & logically organized by visualization techniques for example
    • Identify the main challenges within the issue
    • If the issue still persists; ask these 2 question:
        ◦ is it absolute necessary to the project? (communication with the PO may be required)
        ◦ Can it be postponed?
    • If it’s absolute necessary, Scrum Master can schedule a separate meeting for this issue after it has been organized. Further, it can be well documented for another sprint
    • If it can be postponed, it can be solved offline
    • The PO can communicate with stakeholders to inform them about the situation

---
##### _Scenario 2_

In the beginning of the sprint the tasks were picked up by the development team. However, by the middle of the sprint, development team starts to look to Scrum Master to assign tasks to individual developers.

###### Diagnosis

> There are problems with collaboration & self-organization

###### Remedy

   > Each team member should communicate what he/she can do before looking for the Scrum Master

---
##### _Scenario 3_

If a development team member needs to discuss a task with the Product Owner, the developer approaches Scrum Master to help set up a meeting with the Product Owner.

###### Diagnosis

> Collaboration between PO & development team is not found


###### Remedy

   > Self awareness is required between Product Owner (PO) and development team concerning communication & collaboration which is usually needed on a daily basis.

---
##### _Scenario 4_

The team is using the latest Agile Application Lifecycle Management tool because it is supposed to be most effective. However, most of the team is having hard time getting used to the tool.

###### Diagnosis

> Not familiarity with a specific tool


###### Remedy

   > In most cases, a familiar tool is preferred. Individuals is more important than tools.
    If it’s super power tool, which can make a difference, team may be supported with the necessary support to get familiarity with the tool
