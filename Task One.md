### Task One

---

#### _Waterfall_

##### pros

- Well defined set of inputs with rich docs
- Work understood before execution through extensive planning
- Predefined steps to get predictable results – no ending surprises
- Uses clear structure which not only helps in development but also testing

##### cons

- Lack of communication & feedback which may leads to conflicts & unmatched software
- Not flexible with clients’ requirements. Users can find it complicated to change something half through the project
- Documents over values
- Sequential

---
#### _Agile_


##### pros

- Focusing on delivering working software over documents
- Customer first approach focusing on communication
- Simple – maximizing the work not done (MVP)/core functionalities first
- Flexibility & Valuing feedback
__ Sometimes, users may find that they need to add something half through the project. Or they may need to develop something

##### cons

- Limited documents which may affect the clarity & scope of the project
- Unexpected final product since the project may be redefined as it progresses
- Fragmented software development (e.g. sprints)
- May leads to issues in software quality when the user specify too fancy & not functional requirements esp half through the project
